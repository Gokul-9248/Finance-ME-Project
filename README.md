Projects:

Automated Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline



Description:

Designed and implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process for web applications. Leveraged Git, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, and Ansible to achieve seamless integration and deployment.



Key Technologies Used:

Version Control: Git
Continuous Integration: Jenkins
Containerization: Docker
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
Configuration Management: Ansible
Monitoring and Alerting: Prometheus, Grafana



Responsibilities:

Configured Git hooks to trigger the CI/CD pipeline upon code pushes to the master branch.
Automated the build, test, package, and containerization processes using Jenkins pipelines.
Provisioned test servers dynamically using Terraform and configured them automatically with Ansible.
Orchestrated the deployment of applications to test servers immediately upon availability.
Implemented automated testing using [mention specific test automation tool].
Orchestrated the deployment to production servers after successful testing on the test servers.
Implemented continuous monitoring of test and production servers using Prometheus and Grafana.



Achievements:

Streamlined the development process by automating the entire CI/CD pipeline, reducing manual intervention and deployment time.
Ensured the reliability and consistency of deployments by automating testing and monitoring processes.
Improved team productivity and collaboration by providing a centralized and automated deployment solution.
